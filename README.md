Developing robust system that convert image into corresponding emojis.

#Abstraction

The image-to-emoji conversion process begins with the user providing an input image, which is then processed by the trained CNN model. The model extracts features, detects objects, and analyzes facial expressions to determine the most suitable emoji representation. The selected emoji is subsequently overlaid onto the original image, creating a visually enriched version of the input.
